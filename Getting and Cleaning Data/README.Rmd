##Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Review Project

This Github repository contains code relevant to the peer reviewed project for the Getting and Cleaning data course offered through Johns Hopkins University as part of their Data Science specialization.

The project assesses skill in importing, processing, and tidying data across a number of datasets, such that the final product is a single tidy dataset.  Overview of the datasets used can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

See run_analysis.R for the script that imports and creates the tidy data.

See the following URL to download the various datasets: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The final tidy dataset is found in the text file "means_tibble_text.txt"
